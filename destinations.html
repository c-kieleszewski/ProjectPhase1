        I have been to Los Angeles and stayed around the area. To start off, I
        was taken away by the mountains around me as this was the first time I
        had been near the mountains. Every where I would look I would see
        mountains. There are endless areas to hike around and outside of Los
        Angeles which I would recommend to do for anybody. There is a wide range
        of easy to difficult trails to hike. The drive along the coast near
        Santa Monica was also very nice aswell as the views from the pier. SoFi
        stadium in Inglewood in spectatular with its 360 degree view big screen
        above the field. The size of SoFi stadium is uncomparable to one I've
        been to before due to its sheer size. The rows of seats must go up 6 or
        7 storys into the air.

        Park is the perfect place for anyone to visit such as a young couple
