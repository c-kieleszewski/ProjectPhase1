        Our family owns a cottage on a lake in Gladwin, Michigan. One of my
        favorite places to get dinner at is Piper's Pub. They offer mainly
        american food such as burgers, pizza, and sandwiches. My favorite dish
        at Piper's is their meat pizza. It is a fairly small restaurant but you
        do not have to wait usually. The staff is very nice always and I never
        have anything to complain about. I would recommend Piper's to anyone
        visiting the Gladwin area in Michigan.

        During my stay in Thousand Oaks, CA, I was recommended to try 
        Eggs-N-Things which was right down the street. I must say I can't 
        complain about anything during my breakfast here. The complimentary 
        crepe that was served as an appetizer was fantastic. The pancakes 
        were also great. The staff was very nice and tentative. I would 
        definitely recommend this breakfast restaurant to anybody around 
        the Thousand Oaks Area.

        While I was in California, I also visited the Paradise Falls trail. Paradise Falls is 
        a popular photograph spot in Thousand Oaks, California. The trail 
        took around 45 minutes to reach Paradise Falls and was fairly easy. The way up 
        takes around 1 hour as it is pretty steep and more difficult that way. The reward 
        at the end of the trail was worth all the hiking. The falls are very pretty and I would 
        recommend anyone to see them in the area.
