        Hello, my name is Christopher K and I was born and raised in metro
        Detroit. I attended High School in 2020 where I continued my education
        at Oakland University in Rochester, MI. I have a cat named Ollie. I love
        fishing, traveling, and sports.

        I love fishing. My favorite types of fish to target include norther
        pike, largemouth bass, smallmouth bass, and panfish. My favorite type of
        fishing is casual lake fishing while targeting anything. I like to spend
        most of my free time fishing in the summer.

        I also love to travel. Some places I have been include california and
        the Florida Keys. I enjoyed a bit of hiking while being in California
        and was able to take some incredible pictures. I traveled to Key West,
        Florida during Christmas and had a fun time with my family.

        Finally, I love to watch sports. My favorite sport to watch is
        definitely football and my favorite team is the Detroit Lions. I have
        been to some NFL football games and they are exhilarating every time. I
        also like to watch basketball and baseball. I love the Detroit Pistons
        and Detroit Tigers.
